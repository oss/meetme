These endpoints handle the integration with google cal

google_auth_link
this creates a link to allow the user to verify their account and give meetme access to their data
in addition it generates a state to verify requests 
right now the clientid is setup under Andrew Somers's personal gmail account, though it will be moved eventually
once a user completes the steps on the link, google will redirect them to the provided redirect link with a code and the given state

code 
verifies that the given state is correct and then uses the code to gain a access token and refresh token
the refresh token last forever unless the user removes it, where access tokens last an hour
both of these tokens are saved in the user object 

after this process is done, google_email and google_cal_date can be called
google_email gets the email of the linked account
google_cal_date takes a time range and gives all the events on the primary calendar in that time range

google_remove is used to remove the currently linked account
